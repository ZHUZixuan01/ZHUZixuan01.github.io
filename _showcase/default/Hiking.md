    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
       I have organized one-day hikes around 10 times in Munster. Usually, we depart from the train station and take a regional train for maybe 2 hours (which is free if you are a student or with a Deutschland ticket). And then a casual hike of around 17km for maybe 5h.
The idea is to talk to random people from different areas to know more about the world beyond mathematics.
Therefore, I hope it is something that incurs no cost and that many people can participate in.

  Besides the regional hike, I also went to Tour Mont Blanc this summer, and I would like to recommend everyone to go there at least once, as long as they are capable of continuous mountain climbing.
