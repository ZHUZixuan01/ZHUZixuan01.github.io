    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I value rationality over social compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        My sense of belonging is not shaped by gender, nationality, or ethnicity, but by the collective I truly love and identify with. For example, humanity as a whole---the shared endeavor of all rational beings.
    </p>    
<p> 
  In research, I appreciate mathematics that offers insights and inspiration. And I seek to understand connections between structure and logic
