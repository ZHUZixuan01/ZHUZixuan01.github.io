    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I value rationality over social compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        My sense of belonging is not defined by gender, nationality, or ethnicity, but by the collectives I truly love and identify with, for example, humanity as a whole: the shared endeavor of all rational beings.
    </p> 
    <p>
        I believe that creativity arises from each person's independent and critical thinking, shaped by their own experiences.
    </p> 
<p> 
  In research, I appreciate mathematics that brings insights and inspiration, and I seek to understand connections between structure and logic.
