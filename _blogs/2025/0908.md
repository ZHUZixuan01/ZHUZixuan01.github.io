content_en:     <p>It is due to the board game Great Western Trail that I played with my dear colleagues yesterday. I misjudged the game's process speed and spent a lot on the late investment rather than focusing on the immediate win points. The game was already finishing when my investment started to pay back. <p>I think it might be true as well for life. It is only a few decades for one to be a 'human'. Yet, there is too much preparation to do if one does want to achieve a real own goal. <p> First, one has to learn all the fundamental stuff to survive, to learn to read, to move, to speak, to think, so that one can go further. Based on these, one shall learn to take in information about the world, and one shall learn how to understand the information from outside. These gradually help one to build up a worldview that still needs to be continuously improved. In the meantime, one also needs to explore inside, to understand what kind of people they are, and thus to make sure what they are really motivated to do among all the various possibilities that have appeared in their lives. Only then can one have a real own goal.<p> It took me more than twenty years just to reach this level. However, this is only the start of being a 'human'. A human should try to understand their goal; they should improve their necessary skills, and should keep trying to achieve the goal.<p> But this is only the ideal case. In real life, one would encounter all kinds of difficulties and setbacks that one has to be helped by others and spend a huge amount of time and energy to overcome. Sometimes these problems come like a flood. If one can not stand firmly, they will be defeated. And if they can not rise again, they can no longer be a 'human'.<p> In this way, I realized it is not easy for one to achieve a real own goal in only a few decades. Nevertheless, let me finish with a line from a poem':' 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。

content_zh:  <p>契机是昨天去同事家里玩桌游大西铁。由于错误地估计了游戏速度，选择了错误的游戏策略：对后期的投资操作较多，抢分行为较少，然而刚进入后期游戏就结束了。<p>想来或许人也是这样，从出生到死亡不过几十年。想要真的做成什么事，需要太多准备。<p>首先要学会基本生活技能，保证自己的生存能力，学会走路，阅读，思考为后续的成人打基础。在此之上，人要学会接收外界信息，要学会理解外界信息，渐渐地形成一个仍需要被不断完善的世界观和方法论，并且让自己可以接触到有哪些事是可以去做的。与此同时还要向内探索，了解自己是什么样的人，确定在自己已经接触到的世界里，什么样的事是自己真正想要做的，这样人才能有一个真正属于自己的目标。<p>仅仅是达到这种程度就已经花了我二十多年。然而在此之后才是真正的人的生活的开始。一个人应当去了解自己要做的事，去提升自己的技术，去不断尝试。<p>上述的一切也都只是理想状态下的假设。现实生活中，一个人在生命中可能会遇到各种各样大大小小的问题，人会需要得到他人的帮助，需要自己付出大量的时间精力或者劳动才可以解决这些问题。即使暂时还没有遇到，也需要做好随时应对这些问题的准备。这样一来，可以用在自己身上的时间就更少了。<p>这样想来在一个人活着的六七十年里，可以做好自己真正想做的事并不是一件很容易的事。不仅需要个人努力，也需要很好的运气。路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
