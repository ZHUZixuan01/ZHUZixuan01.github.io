content_en: <p>It is inspired by the board game Great Western Trail that I played with my dear colleagues yesterday. I misjudged the pace of the game and invested too much in the late game rather than focusing on the quick points. By the time my investment started to pay back, the game was already ending. <p>I think it might be similar to life. Human life is only a few decades. Yet we have to spend so much time growing into a real 'human being' before we can achieve something. <p> First, we have to acquire all the fundamentals just to survive. For example, we must learn to read, to move, to speak, and to think, so that we can move to the next steps. Based on these, we shall learn to absorb information about the world and to make sense of it. These gradually help to build up a worldview, which still requires persistent adjustments. In the meantime, we also need to look inward, to understand what kind of person we are, and thus to discover what we may be truly motivated to do among all the various possibilities that life presents. Only then can one have the ability to identify a goal worth pursuing.<p> It took me more than twenty years to reach this point. However, identifying a goal is only the beginning of a true 'human being'. A human being should strive to understand how to reach the goal; they should develop the necessary skills and keep working toward it.<p> However, this is only the ideal case. In real life, we would face uncountable difficulties and setbacks, often needing help from others and spending huge amounts of time and energy to overcome them. Even those who are fortunate enough to temporarily avoid such obstacles must still be prepared, leaving even less time to focus on the goal. <p> That's why I realized that it is not easy for one to achieve one's own goal in only a few decades. Nevertheless, let me finish with a line from a poem： <p>多少事，从来急。<p>天地转，光阴迫。<p>一万年太久，只争朝夕。
content_zh:  <p>契机是昨天去同事家里玩桌游大西铁。由于错误地估计了游戏速度，选择了错误的游戏策略：对后期的投资操作较多，抢分行为较少，然而刚进入后期游戏就结束了。<p>想来或许人也是这样，从出生到死亡不过几十年。想要真的做成什么事，需要太多准备。<p>首先要学会基本生活技能，保证自己的生存能力，学会走路，阅读，思考为后续的成人打基础。在此之上，人要学会接收外界信息，要学会理解外界信息，渐渐地形成一个仍需要被不断完善的世界观和方法论，并且让自己可以接触到有哪些事是可以去做的。与此同时还要向内探索，了解自己是什么样的人，确定在自己已经接触到的世界里，什么样的事是自己真正想要做的，这样人才能有一个真正属于自己的目标。<p>仅仅是达到这种程度就已经花了我二十多年。然而在此之后才是真正的人的生活的开始。一个人应当去了解自己要做的事，去提升自己的技术，去不断尝试。<p>上述的一切也都只是理想状态下的假设。现实生活中，一个人在生命中可能会遇到各种各样大大小小的问题，人会需要得到他人的帮助，需要自己付出大量的时间精力或者劳动才可以解决这些问题。即使暂时还没有遇到，也需要做好随时应对这些问题的准备。这样一来，可以用在自己身上的时间就更少了。<p>这样想来在一个人活着的六七十年里，可以做好自己真正想做的事并不是一件很容易的事。不仅需要个人努力，也需要很好的运气。路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
