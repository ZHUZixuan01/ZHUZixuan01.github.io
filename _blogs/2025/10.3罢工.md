content_zh:  <p>On the 3rd of October, there was a major strike in protest of the Israeli government's interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla. The Global Sumud Flotilla is a non-governmental fleet that aims to send essential supplies to the people in Gaza. According to the labor union, over 2 million people took part in the strike across more than 100 cities in Italy. Demonstrators sang songs for Palestine and waved flags as they marched through the streets.<p>I'm deeply moved. On the one hand, I see that people can be united and organized in a very short time when they witness injustice. On the other hand, demonstrators were fighting for people in Gaza, who live far away from Italy and are completely unrelated to their daily lives.<p>For over a century, ever since people from different countries formed the International Brigades to go to Spain and fight for the freedom of the Spanish people, this spirit has never vanished from history. As long as this spirit endures, I can believe that the beautiful world I dream of will one day become reality.<p> I was so moved and inspired that I wrote a poem: 
<p>霹雳惊雷动九霄，呼歌裂云旗漫桥。<p>万心同涌千里浪，官舟安敢逆滔滔？<p>非为稻粱争寸利，但求公义满天晓。<p>仁火千秋燃未绝，信知桃源路非遥。
